# Project Title

Income Data Analysis


## Description

This project analyzes income data using various machine learning models. The dataset contains information about individuals, including their age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation,

## Files

- **archive/Income.csv**: The dataset containing income data.
- **Main.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and machine learning model training.

## Usage

1. **Open the Project**: Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. **Run the Notebook**: Open [`Main.ipynb`] and run the cells to execute the data analysis and model training.

## Data Analysis

The notebook [`Main.ipynb`] includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset from.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models to predict income.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using cross-validation.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- python
- jupyter (notebook or lab)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`
3. Open the project in Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion

The project successfully analyzed the income data and trained machine learning models to predict income based on individual characteristics. The best performing model was the Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 85%.
